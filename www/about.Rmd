## Framework

The app was developed as a final project for the scientific Graphics Course  [04-GEO-SOS1](http://eagle-science.org/project/scientific-graphics/), which is one of the courses that I took during the second semester of my [MSc. in Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis (EAGLE)](http://eagle-science.org/) at [JMU Wuerzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/).
